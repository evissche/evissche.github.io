                        <p>     Coastal Sweets is a locally-owned business located on the Central Coast selling specialty chocolates and assorted candies. Coastal Sweet's Candies has been making quality chocolate and candy the Coastal way for over 95 years. From the beginning, we took pride in our recipes and insisted on only the finest, freshest ingredients. Today, we're still just as committed to making candy the right way.
    
                            Coastal Sweet's has expanded from one chocolate shop to over 200 shops across America and a flourishing online store. And though we continue to grow, our commitment to tradition, taste, service and quality never wavers. </p><!-- This is a placeholder!
